## Sample-based synthesis
### Description

The principal difference with sample-based synthesis is that the seed waveforms are sampled sounds or instruments instead of fundamental waveforms such as sine and saw waves used in other types of synthesis like subtractive and additive synthesis. 

### Advantages

 - lower processing power
 - In a contrast to analog synthesizers, the circuitry does not have to be duplicated to allow more voices to be played at once.

## Subtractive Synthesis

### Description
In subtractive synthesis, complex waveforms are generated by oscillators and then shaped with filters to remove or boost specific frequencies. Subtractive synthesis is characterized as "rich" and "warm".[

## Additive Synthesis
### Description
In additive synthesis, a large number of waveforms, usually sine waves, are combined into a composite sound
